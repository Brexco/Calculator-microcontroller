# Introduction
The Calculator-Microcontroller is a system with goals are:

  - creats a HTTP network\n
  - calculating simple mathematical problems
  - saves calculated calculations
# config-file 
The configuration for setting up both the mDNS and the calculator can be found in the file "Arduino_IDE_ESP-mDNS_Config.ino".
## Requirements 
# ESP8266
  The Arduino code works only on an ESP8266.
